  Introduction

  NaCl (pronounced "salt") is a new easy-to-use high-speed software library for
  network communication, encryption, decryption, signatures, etc. NaCl's goal is
  to provide all of the core operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic
  tools.

  Of course, other libraries already exist for these core operations. NaCl advances
  the state of the art by improving security, by improving usability, and by
  improving speed.

  The following report contrasts NaCl with other libraries from a security perspective:
